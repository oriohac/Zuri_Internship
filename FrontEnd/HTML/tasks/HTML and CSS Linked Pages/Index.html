                <h3>About Myself</h3>
                A National Diploma holder in computer Science,
                and about to gain his B.Sc. in the same field,
                a lover of technology, it's development and
                usage of technology to better the immediate society.
                I started getting to know about programming in 2015,
                with Visual Basic 6.0, as it was the language used
                for teaching Introduction to Programming. I gained more interest
                in programming in 2016, after I started building websites with
                Content Management System(Wordpress). In 2018 I started
                learning Mobile Application Development, where I made several
                research and learnt by myself, today I can build Android
                Mobile Applications using Kotlin, XML and Jetpack Compose.
                I have great admiration for web development and the zeal to teach
                others, that was why I enrolled into Zuri x I4G internship
                to learn full stack web development, with Python, HTML, CSS and Javascript,
                and in turn teach others who may not have such opportunity after the programme.
